                <dd>Aries is the first fire sign in the zodiac, the other fire 
                    signs being Leo and Sagittarius. Individuals born between these dates,
                    depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, 
                    may be called Arians or Ariens.</dd>

                <dt>Taurus </dt>
                <dd>The sign of Taurus is associated with several myths and bull 
                    worship from several ancient cultures. It was the first sign 
                    of the zodiac established among the Mesopotamians, who called 
                    it "The Great Bull of Heaven," as it was the constellation 
                    through which the Sun rose on the vernal equinox at that time</dd>

                <dd>In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Pollux and Castor were known 
                            as the Great Twins. Their names were Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea,
                            meaning "The Mighty King" and "The One who has arisen from the 
                            Underworld". Both names are titles of Nergal, a major Babylonian 
                            god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the underworld.</dd>

                <dt>Cancer   </dt>
                <dd>Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac, which the sun enters at 
                    the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, on approximately 
                    June 21.</dd>

                <dt>Leo    </dt>
                <dd>Egyptians worshipped the constellation, which they referred to as 
                    "Knem", because it was present during the flooding of the Nile River. 
                    This event signified plentiful harvests for the upcoming year, and 
                    the people interpreted it as a gift from the earth.Water is the 
                    element associated with Cancer and alongside Scorpio and Pisces, 
                    it forms the water trigon. </dd>
